Spring Block Launcher / Oscillator

Our project is a combination of a simple harmonic spring-block oscillator and various other scenarios. 
The initial conditions for the oscillation can be set by the user using sliders and buttons. 
Pressing the start button initiates the simple harmonic motion of the block. 
After the start button has been pressed, the launch button can be pressed to release the block from the spring system. 
The block will then collide with another block of equal mass in an elastic collision. 
The other block will then either fall off a cliff of adjustable height; go onto a ramp of adjustable angle; or enter a loop of adjustable radius. 
The user can choose which scenario the block will enter.
There are graphs of the mechanical energy of the system and the x-position of the block. 

Special Notes:
The maximum value of the initial velocity slider is dynamically set so that the block never goes further than x=0.
