Spring Block Launcher

Concept:
Simulates a spring block system that transitions into an elastic collision with a block that travels through a preset path chosen by the user.
Features:
Start, Reset, and Launch Button
Real-time graphing of position, and mechanical energy
Choice of three adjustable presets:
-Cliff with adjustable height
-Upwards or Downwards Slope with adjustable angle
-Loop with adjustable radius
Choice of having springs set in series or parallel each with different k-values
Option of friction with an adjustable coefficient of friction slider
Two graphs representing the x position of the object as well as the mechanical energy in the system, split into kinetic and potential energy
